  <p>B-LA CONNECT is a platform to promote the cooperation and
    interlinking between the two sister
    cities’ creative communities.
  </p>
  <p>Over the next two years a major exhibition and exchange project is
    scheduled to take place
    between artist/curator run project spaces and collectives from
    Berlin and Los Angeles:
  </p>
  <p>In June 2019, 20 art spaces from Los Angeles will exhibit in 22 art spaces from Berlin. The
    interdisciplinary program includes art exhibitions, film screenings, performances, talks, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
  The following year, in 2020, the Berlin art spaces will travel to LA for a return visit.

  B-LA CONNECT understands itself as an international cultural exchange on a grass-roots level.
It brings together members of different art spheres and scenes from both cities. New opportunities
for interacting and connecting with each other are created and extended locally inside and
transnationally between the two cities.
</p>
  <p>
    In the sense of a positive globality B-LA CONNECT seeks to advance the cultural partnership
between Berlin and Los Angeles. B-LA CONNECT wants to celebrate urban diversity, show
presence and stand against reactionary forces. Berlin and Los Angeles share the urban self-image
of being the world in small, a place of cultural diversity and individual freedom. In light of the rising
authoritarian and regressive currents worldwide the two cities stand for a liberal and cosmopolitan
openness towards the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    B-LA CONNECT wants to build bridges where others erect walls.
